# Bosch Assessment - Data Scientist

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the Bosch assessment. Namely, a Jupyter notebook and a MS PowerPoint presentation.

## Objective & Tasks

The objective was to perform a thorough analysis of the automobile dataset and build a machine learning model
to predict a target variable. 

Following the stages:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis. Including the distribution of data, detecting outliers, and exploring relationships between features.

2. Feature Engineering and Selection: Based on the EDA, new features were engineered and the most relevant ones were selected.

3. Machine Learning Model: Build a machine learning model to predict the "price" variable. Including the hyperparameter tuning and validation.

4. Evaluation and Interpretation: Evaluation of the performance of the model using appropriate metrics. Interpretation of  model's predictions, and discussion of its strengths and weaknesses.
